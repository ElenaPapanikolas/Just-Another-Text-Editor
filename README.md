## Description
Just Another Text Editor: JATE is in fact, just another text editor, BUT its also a Progressive Web Application text editor! It uses the data persistance techniques of local storage, the indexedDB database, and caching so the user can write whatever they need, whenever they need. It doesn't matter if they're online or offline, by using JATE, everything will be saved and ready to go.
